# 1. Find the filepath to your Python executable, and fill it in the line below

export PATH="$PATH:/your/python/pathname/here"

# For example, my .bashrc file has this line:
# export PATH="$PATH:C:\Users\zdelrosario\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38"

# 2. Save this `.bashrc` file to your home directory. This foler should 
# include your computer username.
# For example, my username is `zdelrosario`, so my home directory is 
# C:\Users\zdelrosario
